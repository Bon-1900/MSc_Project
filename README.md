## About

As the application of robotics expands, the need to operate in high altitude and isolated locations soon surpasses the capability of ground-based robots. The solution to the issue is the concept of aerial manipulation, a drone-based robotic manipulator. While many research projects have made valuable developments, few address the scenario where the operation locates on a vertical surface. Potential applications include large-scale painting, maintenance of wind turbines, ARC (aerial robotics construction) and last-mile delivery. Such tasks require a frontal workspace which puts high stress on the droneâ€™s digital controller and propeller motors.

This project designs and experiments with a counterweight stability control mechanism targeting any stock drones available on the market. The system enhances flight performance by minimising the net torque applied to the drone body. Experiments have been conducted with numerous weight configurations in various tasks. The physical test result indicates a 65% improvement in the frontal manipulation capacity reaching 0.35kg with the aid of this device on DJI F450.

This project is presented for the degree of MSc Robotics and Computation at University College London.
